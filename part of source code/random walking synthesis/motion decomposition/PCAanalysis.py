# singular value decomposition factorises your data matrix such that:

#   M = U*S*V.T     (where '*' is matrix multiplication)
# 
# * U and V are the singular matrices, containing orthogonal vectors of
#   unit length in their rows and columns respectively.
#
# * S is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of M - these 
#   values squared divided by the number of observations will give the 
#   variance explained by each PC.
#
# * if M is considered to be an (observations, features) matrix, the PCs
#   themselves would correspond to the rows of S^(1/2)*V.T. if M is 
#   (features, observations) then the PCs would be the columns of
#   U*S^(1/2).
#
# * since U and V both contain orthogonal vectors, U*V.T is equivalent 
#   to a whitened version of M.
